## Types of research articles


* Conceptual: theory, methodology 

* Review: narrative, meta-analysis, bibliometric

* Empirical: survey, experiment, econometric modelling

* Practical contribution: software, macros
  
---
## What is contribution?

* **E**xtend theories
* **C**larify theories
* **A**pply theories into a new setting


```{r, out.width = "200px", echo=FALSE, fig.align='right', include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://absolutelymaybe.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2020/05/Eureka.jpg")
```

## Why contributions?

* Increasing rigour

* Increasing relevance
---

## Tips

### Learning

Attempt to: 
 * replicate previous studies
   + re-derived mathematical formulations
   + replicate past simulations
 * Read original papers (first-hand exposure)

### Engagement
 * Stay on the same topic
 * Build research vocabularies
 * Follow the conversation
 * Try to publish
 * Leave your footprint: move to another domain after publising 2-3 articles
 * Thinking of comeback

# Writing a paper

 * Articulate research contribution(s)
   e.g, We contribute to literature by demonstrating that Markov chain can not be used to lock burglars.
   
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.height="50%", out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/chain_gang.png")
```
